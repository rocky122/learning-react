Refs 

Refs make it possible to access the dom nodes within React 
Common use case is focussing the text input 

For example : 
Suppose we have a login form and when it gets loaded we want the username 
field to get foccussed by default. 
It is common to create the refs within the constructor so that it can be accessed 
inside the component throughout 
React.createRef()
You create a reference using React.createRef


Second Approach is the Callback Refs 
React will call the callbackref method will null when the component 
unmounts and with the current element when the component mounts. 
Create a property 
Then create a method that assigns the property with the DOM element 
that is passed as a parameter 

Refs to a class component
