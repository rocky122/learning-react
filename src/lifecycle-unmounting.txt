Unmounting Phase methods 

componentWillUnmount 

Method is invoked immediately before a component is unmounted 
and destroyed 
In this method you can perform some cleanup tasks like cancelling network 
requests, removing event handlers, cancelling any subscriptions and also invalidate 
timers. 
Do not call the setState method because the component is never re-rendered once it has unmounted.
