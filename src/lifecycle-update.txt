Updating Lifecycle Hook Methods 
With latest updates of the latest
React version 

These hooks are triggered as a result of change in props 
or change in state of the component 

1. getDerivedStateFromProps(props,state)

This method is triggered when we have the props and the state 
and there is a change in the props.This method is called every time 
a component is re-rendered 
Set the state This method is used when the state depends on the component 
Do not cause any side effects in this method i.e reaching out to server and all 
This method is rarely used in updating phase 
This method is mostly used in mounting phase of the component 

2. shouldComponentUpdate method(nextProps,nextState) 

This method is triggered when the component receives new 
props or new state and decides whether at all the component 
should update or not with those changes.By default,all the components 
re-render whenever their props or state changes. 

This method dictates if the component should rerender or not .
Compare the existingProps and existing State values with 
the nextProps and nextState and let React dictate whether to 
update the component or not. 
This method is for performance optimization 
Do not cause side effects i.e HTTP requests Calling the setState 
method 

render 
read props and state and return JSX 
Do not change the state or interact with the DOM or make 
AJAX calls here. 

getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps,prevState) 

Called right before the changes from the Virtual DOM 
are to be reflected in the DOM 
Rarely used method 
This is used only when you need to capture some information 
from the DOM 
Method will either return null or return a value. 
Returned value will be passed as the third argument to the next 
method 

componentDidUpdate(prevProps,prevState,snapshot)

Called after the render is finished in the re-render cycles 
You can make sure that the components and its child components have 
properly rendered itself. 
Called only once during each re-render cycle. 
Side effects can be placed inside this method 
You can make AJAX calls inside this method 
But here you will have to compare the prevProps with the newProps 
and then decide whether to make the AJAX call or not. 
So as to prevent unnessary requests from occuring
