React Portals 

Portal is used to define new hierrarchy for components 
wherein you can nest other components but inside some other 
root component of the application and not the App Component. 
The App Component is mounted onto the Root DOM node. You can 
unmount any component from the root dom node and mount it 
to some other root element using React Portals.
