Why Higher Order Components ? 

HOC 
A higher order component is a pattern where a function takes a 
component as an argument and returns a new component. 

SYNTAX 
const newComponent = higherOrderComponent(originalComponent);

Typically hoc adds some extra functionality or some data to the original 
component so the new component can also be referred to as enhanced component. 

const enhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(originalComponent);
